          <p>When was the last time you complained about having homework to do, or having to go to school? The majority of students would say that they can remember a time when they would rather be anywhere but school; however, education is a privilege that we often overlook. Millions of women across the globe do not have access to quality education. We wanted to solve this problem by creating the Worldwide Women's Education Connections program, which is a program that allows women to find resource centers in their area, connect with online teachers, and find online resources to further their education needs. We hope you will support us in our fight to educate the women of today!</p>
